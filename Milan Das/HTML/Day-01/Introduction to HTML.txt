Objective: What is HTTP protocol

1.  In the past, the network connectivity use to transfer the files and resources across the network in a stream.
    Very often it was seen, that the connectivity got disrupted while transfering the file.
    When a file got transfered from the source to the destination, very likely the network got disrupted. The data was
    resend from the begining. It took long time to transfer the data from the source to the destination.

		+----------+                        +----------+
		|          | 						|          |
		|          +----->------->------>---+          |
		|          |						|          |
		+----------+						+----------+
		   Source                            Destination

    To transfer 1000 bytes from the source computer to the destination, in the process after 950 bytes are 
    already transfered, there is an accidental disruption, the entire file had to be transmitted from the begining.


2. The engineers created TCP/IP protocol in which the data was sliced to small packets. Each packet was wrapped
   in a header and a trailer. The header kept the information about the packet and the address of the previous packet.
   The trailer kept information about the next adjoining packet.

			+---+----------+---+		+---+----------+---+        +---+----------+---+
			| H	|          | T |		| H |          | T |		| H	|          | T |
			+---+----------+---+		+---+----------+---+		+---+----------+---+
                  Packets-1				      Packets-2       		      Packets-3

3. HTTP protocol is a improvement of the TCP/IP protocol. When HTTP protocol was created, the HTML language
   was also created. HTML scripting language became a model data for transfering across the HTTP connectivity.

What is a computer language?
	= A computer language is a symbolic representation where the execution is done in sequence of line number
	= The language provides facility to jump and to loop across a set of lines
	= The language has capabilities to iterate, compute and to make condition checking

There are 3 types of computer languages:
	1.  Passive language
		Is that which can't make any computation iteration, and condition checking.
		It is created for presentation purpose only. How to display the data on the screen.
		Examples of passive language are:
			SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)
            HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

	2.  Active language
		Is a real computer language. It is built to solve mission critical problems.
		They are executed in the machine in which they reside. It uses the resources of the residing machine.
		Examples of active languages are:
			COBOL, ForTran, Pascal, C, C++, Java, ....

	3.  Dynamic language
		A program that resides in another machine or the server machine. When request is sent to executed from the
		local machine, it is executed using the server resources and the result is transmitted to the requesting
		machine. Programs are requested to execute from another machine and the result is transmitted to the
		requesting machine.
		The result of the Dynamic language is always in form of Passive language source code, i.e. is HTML.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
HTML is created by Tim Berners-Lee.
HTML is a language that is created by elements.
HTML is not a case sensitive language.
HTML elements are reserve words. Each HTML element is wrapped by a pair of angle brackets <>
HTML has 2 kinds of elements
    1. Self terminated element
       Example:
            <br />
            <img />
            <hr />
    2. Terminator required element
       Example:
            <html>...</html>
            <head>...</head>
            <body>...</body>
            <form>...</form>

The HTML source is embedded with the principal element that is <HTML>...</HTML>.
There are basically 2 sub-elements of the principal element that is <html>...</html>. These sub-elements are
the <head>...</head> and <body>...</body>.
The structure of the HTML source code is:
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

The HTML programs are ment to be executed by the Internet Browser. For example:
    1. Netscape Navigator
    2. Internet Explorer
    3. Opera
    4. FireFox
    5. Google Chrome
    6. Safari

Every internet browser has two parts:
    1. Header
    2. Body
